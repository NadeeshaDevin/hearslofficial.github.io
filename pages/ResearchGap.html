        <h1>Research Gap</h1>
        <p>
          In the past, it was a well-known fact that sign language devices existed for various languages, but most of these devices could only translate basic words and individual alphabet characters. Furthermore, these devices were in the early stages of development, which prompted us to embark on a mission to elevate them to an advanced level. While there were previous research efforts in Sri Lanka aimed at translating Sinhala sign language using specialized devices and cameras, they remained in their infancy, and their practical implementation was limited.
            <br /><br />
            In light of these challenges, we set out to create a smartphone application capable of translating complete sentences from sign language to Sinhala (Singlish). Our research aimed to bridge the gap between the hearing and speech impaired community and the wider Sri Lankan population. Unlike the general public, people with these disabilities faced issues when communicating using modern chat applications like WhatsApp. Our solution was a unique chat application, catering to the hearing, speech, and visually impaired individuals, facilitating communication through Sign Animations, Sign Emojis, Sinhala Text, and Sinhala Voice messages according to the user's specific disability.
            <br /><br />
            To enable voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion in Sinhala, we incorporated Google text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs. Additionally, we developed a specialized SAESV Converter (Sign Animation, Emoji to Sinhala Voice Converter) API, a groundbreaking tool for transforming Sign Language Animations and Emojis into Sinhala voice.
            <br /><br />
            To personalize the application for users based on their disability, we implemented a chatbot, which allowed users to specify their disability (blindness, speech impairment, or hearing impairment) and customized the application accordingly.
            <br /><br />
            Our research contributed to the development of a system capable of producing Sinhala sign language word-by-word, making it more comprehensible for the hearing-impaired. Unlike previous research in Sri Lanka, our system was unique in its approach, focusing on everyday words. Furthermore, users could input their ideas by voice or Sinhala typing, a feature previously unavailable for the Sinhala language.
            <br /><br />
            We believed that our application could significantly benefit the Sinhalese hearing-impaired community in Sri Lanka, bridging the gap between them and the wider population. This research marked the first attempt to create a comprehensive database of Sinhala sign language meanings in 'Singlish,' paving the way for more accessible communication.
            <br /><br />
            However, it's important to note that there were no existing applications, devices, or software in Sri Lanka capable of translating 'Singlish' sign language into the relevant Sinhala voice. This research filled that void, providing a unique solution. Users had the option to select the correct Sinhala word related to the sign shown by the system, adding a level of personalization to the translation process.
            <br /><br />
            Our research represented a significant step forward, aiming to improve the lives of hearing, speech, and visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka and foster greater inclusivity and understanding among the community.
