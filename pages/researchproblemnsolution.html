            <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 7.5% of Sri Lanka's population has hearing loss, with additional percentages facing blindness and vision impairments. In 2023, these figures may have increased. Deaf and blind individuals in Sri Lanka encounter societal challenges due to a lack of awareness and resources for sign language. To address this, the author aims to develop a system that converts 'Singlish' sign language to Sinhala voice speech. The system's purpose is to facilitate communication and inclusion for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Sri Lanka. It addresses barriers in education, employment, and social interaction, aiming to reduce stigma and improve social inclusion. The article also highlights the need for technology solutions to bridge the communication gap and improve accessibility for the deaf and mute community. This research emphasizes the importance of culturally sensitive technology solutions to promote social equity and inclusion.</p>

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Special Sign Emojis and Animations: The chat application will feature a unique set of sign Emojis and animations specially designed to facilitate communication for the deaf and mute community. Users, including the general population, can employ these symbols to chat and express themselves effectively.</p>
            <p>Sinhala Voice Capture and Conversion: The solution will incorporate an inbuilt feature for Sinhala voice capture and conversion. This technology will enable users to transform spoken Sinhala into sign Emojis or animations, enhancing communication with those who rely on sign language for expression.</p>
            <p>Sign Detection System with Singlish Conversion: Additionally, a system with advanced computer vision capabilities will be implemented. This system can detect signs presented to a camera and accurately decipher the meaning of those signs. It will then convert the detected meaning into 'Singlish,' which represents the Sinhala meaning of the sign. This feature will significantly benefit the deaf and mute community in their interactions with others.</p>
